## ⚡ The Big Picture

Retaining existing customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones, yet identifying *who* is about to walk away remains a challenge.

This project builds an end-to-end intelligence hub that ingests raw transaction feeds, processes RFM metrics via SQLite, and deploys multi-model Machine Learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression) to forecast churn risk in real time.

## 🚀 Key Features & Capabilities

* **Dynamic Data Ingestion**: Supports real-time CSV uploads or seamlessly falls back to synthetic data pipelines.
* **In-Memory SQLite Engine**: High-performance SQL queries aggregate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores directly on the fly.
* **Multi-Model Benchmark Suite**: Compares Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression across ROC-AUC curves, confusion matrices, and F1-scores.
* **Real-Time Risk Simulator**: Adjust live customer attributes (age, purchase frequency, recency, order values) to evaluate churn probabilities on demand.
* **Executive Summary Generator**: Automates downloading high-level strategic briefs formatted in clean HTML for leadership handoffs.
